This was part of a physics optimization I was working on to allow for persistent entities to exist and still function in parts of the world that were unloaded. The hope was to create a fully persistent world with async asset loading and unloading. The project was mostly completed, but the group had lost interest so I started working on it as a secondary project. The hope being I could create an engine agnostic framework that I could load into Unreal (using the .net extension) or Unity. Please note that there are a few classes I built the AABB tree off of particularly monogame's bounding box and ray and their associated enums. However, they were modified by me to fit certain OOP practices that I prefered over the way they were originall written.
